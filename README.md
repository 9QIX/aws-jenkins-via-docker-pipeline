# How To Setup Jenkins via Docker and Connect it to GitHub by Creating a Pipeline (AWS EC2)
If you are learning Jenkins just like me, you will find that it is preferable if the Jenkins is running on a server that can be accessed by other applications if need be.
We will achieve exactly that by deploying Jenkins inside an AWS EC2 instance but inside a docker container, the reason I use docker is that it is an optimal way of keeping the environment isolated but also because I am learning docker at the same time.
